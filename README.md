A calculator parser/interpreter made in rust.

Can be executed through the terminal, starting a loop allowing the user to enter an expression, and printing the evaluated result.

Additionally:
 - Entering ':exit', the loop will break and the program will exit.
 - Entering ':clear' will clear the screen. 

### TODO:

  - ~~Report error reasons during parsing.~~ (Done)
  - Implement GUI?
    - Possibly using Druid (see: https://docs.rs/druid/latest/druid/)
