A calculator parser/interpreter made in rust.

Can be executed through the terminal, starting a loop allowing the user to enter an expression, and printing the evaluated result. The loop will exit if the user enters 'exit'.
 
### TODO:

  - ~~Report error reasons during parsing.~~ (Done)
  - Implement GUI?
